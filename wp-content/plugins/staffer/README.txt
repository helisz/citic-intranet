Staff management for WordPress.

== Description ==
Staffer uses custom post types for staff/employee management, allowing users to easily create and manage an onsite staff directory, and is built in a way to be compatible with essentionally any theme. Staffer also supports the display of staff members via a shortcode.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the \'staffer\' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the Settings panel to set up Staffer.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Do I Use Staffer's Shortcodes? =

Follow this format for shortcodes:

[staffer]

The above example would output all of the staff listings in default order.

To fine-tune, you can use parameters:

[staffer number="5" department="slug" layout="grid"]

In the above example, “number” refers to the number of entries to retrieve, and “department” refers to the department name slug. For instance, if you only wanted to show a list of members in department term with the “management” slug, you would pass “management” as a parameter. Layout can be either `grid` or `list`.

Other parameters include “order” and “orderby” — and all parameters are optional.

Using the extra parameters, you could reorder the entries using WP_Query’s order and orderby parameters.

For example, if you wanted to display 50 staff members, ordered by name alphabetically, you would do the following:

[staffer number="50" order="ASC" orderby="name"]

= How Can I Set the Order of Staff Profiles? =

For now, use a custom ordering plugin, such as Post Types Order, available in the WordPress plugin repository. I plan on adding this functionality to Staffer in the future.

= What Size Should the Staff Images Be? =

When you upload an image, a custom thumbnail for Staffer is automatically generated, so feel free to use any image size for your Staff profiles.

= Where Can I Get Support? =
